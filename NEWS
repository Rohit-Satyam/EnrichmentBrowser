CHANGES IN VERSION 2.10.0
-------------------------

    o Adding scripts to inst/scripts to invoke the EnrichmentBrowser from the 
      command line (for non-R users)   
    o GRN compilation: supporting additional pathway databases (via graphite)   
    o Caching for download of GO and KEGG gene sets (via BiocFileCache)
    o Default output destination changed to
      rappdirs::user_data_dir("EnrichmentBrowser")   
    o Function names: deprecation of x.x notation  
      - read.eset -> readSE
      - probe.2.gene.eset -> probe2gene
      - de.ana -> deAna
      - compile.grn.from.kegg -> compileGRN
      - ggea.graph -> ggeaGraph   
      - make.example.data -> makeExampleData

------------------------

    o Major migration from ExpressionSet to SummarizedExperiment

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.4.0
------------------------

    o Adding a min.cpm filter for RNA-seq data to de.ana
    o Additional sbea methods: gsa, mgsa, padog, globaltest, roast, camera, gsva
    o Additional nbea methods: netgsa, degraph, topologygsa, ganpa, cepa 

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2.0
-------------------------

    o Slight modification on ORA's hypergeometric p-value calculation according to

    o Adapting GGEA to also deal with 2-column GRNs
    o Adapting SPIA to deal with non-kegg gene sets
    o Including EmpiricalBrownsMethod (ebm) among sbea methods

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0.0
-------------------------

    o major overhaul of the look'n'feel based on ReportingTools
    o interactive graphics using imageMap
    o reworked set and graph view
    o new kegg view based on pathview
    o adaption of specific local statistics for RNA-seq data 
      for sample-permutation methods GSEA, SAFE, and SAMGS
    o Including PathNet among nbea methods
    o GSEA permutation approximation based on npGSEA
    o extended combination functionality
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.0
------------------------

    o de.ana: extensions for RNA-seq now includes DESeq and edgeR
    o get.go.genesets: new getter for GO genesets
    o de.ana: now based on limma functionality 
    o ggea.graph: extended control of layout
    o ggea: 
        * permutation p-value now based on fast edge resampling
        * p-value approximation now based on gaussian mixture
