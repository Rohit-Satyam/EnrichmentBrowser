  go.onto = c("BP", "MF", "CC"),
  go.mode = c("GO.db", "biomart"),

\arguments{
\item{org}{An organism in (KEGG) three letter code, e.g. \sQuote{hsa} for
\sQuote{Homo sapiens}. Alternatively, this can also be a text file storing 
gene sets in GMT format. See details.}

\item{db}{Database from which gene sets should be retrieved. Currently, 
either 'go' (default) or 'kegg'.}

\item{cache}{Logical.  Should a locally cached version used if available?
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{go.onto}{Character. Specifies one of the three GO ontologies: 'BP'
(biological process), 'MF' (molecular function), 'CC' (cellular component).
Defaults to 'BP'.}

\item{go.mode}{Character. Determines in which way the gene sets are retrieved.
This can be either 'GO.db' or 'biomart'.  The 'GO.db' mode creates the gene
sets based on BioC annotation packages - which is fast, but represents not
necessarily the most up-to-date mapping. In addition, this option is only
available for the currently supported model organisms in BioC.  The
'biomart' mode downloads the mapping from BioMart - which can be time
consuming, but allows to select from a larger range of organisms and
contains the latest mappings.  Defaults to 'GO.db'.}

\item{msigdb.cat}{Character. MSigDB collection category: 'H' (hallmark), 
'C1' (genomic position), 'C2' (curated databases), 'C3' (binding site motifs),
'C4' (computational cancer), 'C5' (Gene Ontology), 'C6' (oncogenic), 
'C7' (immunologic). See references.}

\item{msigdb.subcat}{Character. MSigDB collection subcategory. Depends on the
chosen MSigDB collection category. For example, 'MIR' to obtain microRNA targets
from the 'C3' collection. See references.}

\item{return.type}{Character. Determines whether gene sets are returned
as a simple list of gene sets (each being a character vector of gene IDs), or
as an object of class \code{\linkS4class{GeneSetCollection}}.}

\item{gs}{A list of gene sets (character vectors of gene IDs).}

\item{gmt.file}{Gene set file in GMT format. See details.}
}
\value{
For \code{getGenesets}: a list of gene sets (vectors of gene IDs).
For \code{writeGMT}: none, writes to file.
}
\description{
Functionality for retrieving gene sets for an organism under
investigation from databases such as GO and KEGG. Parsing and writing a list
of gene sets from/to a flat text file in GMT format is also supported.

The GMT (Gene Matrix Transposed) file format is a tab delimited file format
that describes gene sets.  In the GMT format, each row represents a gene
set.  Each gene set is described by a name, a description, and the genes in
the gene set. See references.

\examples{

    # (1) Typical usage for gene set enrichment analysis with GO:
    # Biological process terms based on BioC annotation (for human)
    go.gs <- getGenesets(org="hsa", db="go")
    
    # eq.:  
    # go.gs <- getGenesets(org="hsa", db="go", go.onto="BP", go.mode="GO.db")

    # Alternatively:
    # downloading from BioMart 
    # this may take a few minutes ...
    \donttest{
     go.gs <- getGenesets(org="hsa", db="go", mode="biomart")
    }

    # (2) Defining gene sets according to KEGG  
    kegg.gs <- getGenesets(org="hsa", db="kegg")

    # (3) Obtaining *H*allmark gene sets from MSigDB
    \donttest{
     hall.gs <- getGenesets(org="hsa", db="msigdb", msigdb.cat="H")
    }

    # (4) parsing gene sets from GMT
    gmt.file <- system.file("extdata/hsa_kegg_gs.gmt", package="EnrichmentBrowser")
    gs <- getGenesets(gmt.file)     
    
    # (5) writing gene sets to file
    writeGMT(gs, gmt.file)
